## Important
There is a bug that i cannot resolve! When any rating button is clicked, it must be clicked in the rating, not the button itself. Otherwise, when the form is submited, the **error message** will be triggered.

If somebody know how to fix this bug, please contact me. I'll be pleased to get some help.
